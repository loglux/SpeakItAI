## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/loglux/SpeakItAI.git
cd SpeakItAI
```
### 🔐 Azure Setup (Required)

Before running this app, you need an active Azure Speech resource.

1. Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/)
2. Create a **Speech** resource (Free F0 tier available)
3. Copy the **Key** and **Region** from the resource's "Keys and Endpoint" section
4. You will paste them into a `.env` file as shown below:

### 2. Create `.env` File

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then fill in your Azure credentials:

```env
AZURE_KEY=your_azure_key
AZURE_REGION=your_azure_region
```

> 💡 Example region: `ukwest`, `eastus`, `westeurope`, etc.

---

### 3. Install Dependencies

Using virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 4. Run the App

```bash
python app.py
```

---

## 📝 Usage Notes

- If both textbox and file are provided, the file takes priority.
- Only `.txt` files are accepted for upload.
- The output is saved and played as a `.wav` file.
- If a voice does not support styles, "default" will be used automatically.

## 🧩 Configuration Notes

### Voice Configuration (`config.json`)

- Run `tts/azure/update_config.py` to fetch the latest Azure voice data.
- This generates a new `tts/azure/config.json` with all supported languages, voices, genders, and available styles.
- The app reads from `config.json` at runtime to populate the voice and style options.

### Language Filter (`config.py`)

- The app UI shows only the languages defined in `LANGUAGE_LABELS` in `config.py`.
- If `LANGUAGE_LABELS` is **empty**, the app will display **all languages using locale codes** (e.g., `fr-FR`, `hi-IN`).
- This gives you control over the dropdown list: show only selected languages or all available.
- To include a named language:

```python
LANGUAGE_LABELS = {
    "en-GB": "English (UK)",
    "ru-RU": "Russian",
    "pl-PL": "Polish",  
    # etc.
}
```

---

## 🨠 Architecture Note

The codebase is modular and ready for extension:
- Add new languages or accents in `tts/config.py`
- Replace the interface with FastAPI or Flask without touching `core.py`
- Support alternative providers like ElevenLabs, Bark, or Google Cloud TTS later
